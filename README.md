# DBS UX Engineer Test - Login Component

https://rachellesg.github.io/dbs-test/

This repository contains my solution for the DBS UX Engineer Test, which involves designing and building a login component using Angular, reusable UI components, and design tokens. The login component is intended to be rendered in a modern web browser.

## Technologies Used

- Angular: A popular JavaScript framework for building web applications.
- HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of the login component.
- CSS: Styling language used to define the appearance of the login component.
- TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript used for writing Angular code.

## Installation and Usage

To run the login component in a local development environment, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
- Navigate to the project directory: cd dbs-test
- Install the dependencies: npm install
- Start the development server: npm start
- Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to view the login component.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to DBS for providing this opportunity to showcase my skills as a UX Engineer. The test was challenging and allowed me to apply my knowledge of Angular, reusable UI components, and design tokens in a real-world scenario.
